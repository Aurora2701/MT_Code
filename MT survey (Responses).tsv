At this point, a certain peice of music kicked in that turned the moment up to 11. Then the actual moment of accusation occured which was excellent. I had gone from lying in my bed, to sitting up the whole time, with literal chills and goosebumps. I thought my head was going to explode with excitement. . It was a long moment, but none of it felt drawn out, and the whole time i couldn't believe it. It was a perfect combination of music, sound effects, and story. Graphical detail didn't really have anything to do with it. I would like to add that this moment would only have been possible after playing the first two games in the series.

I saw the hate all since it came out and generally had no reason not to trust a lot of what I heard. After almost 4,000 hours of the other games over 2 years, and finishing everything finally feeling ready for 5, I was ready for it to maybe be bad. I played with the friend mentioned and within the first minutes I was shocked. Just the art and music in the first sequence, and the style was incredible. The animation some of the best I have seen from a game, and it was 7 years old! The flow of working with my friend and how natural all the big changes felt was amazing. Every part of that game gave me some sort of shock. It is now my friends second favorite entry, but when we played and got to the credits it was his favorite.
